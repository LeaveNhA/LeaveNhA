*As a student of Programming Language Theory, I am dedicated to studying, creating, and refining elegant and expressive languages and systems that empower machines to reason, learn, and create in ways that enhance our human experience. By harnessing the beauty of mathematics, these tools can help us solve complex problems and inspire breakthroughs in fields such as AI, healthcare, and sustainability.*

Hard-working MIS graduate, theoretical Computer Science student, M.Sc. in Data Science, with a passion for Programming Language Theory and Math. Clojurescript compiler, Doge (Dg) language and ecosystem contributor. Xiana core developer team member. The Clojurescript Exercism Track Maintainer. Getting ready for my Master and Ph.D. in PLT. Gonna be a Programming Language Theorist and inherit the studies and works of J. McCarthy! üôèüèª
Studying, teaching and consulting about Programming Languages, Frameworks and libraries' design choices. Solved --almost-- every type of problems in many domains in the ways that you can't imagine and euphoric about to see the new ones.
